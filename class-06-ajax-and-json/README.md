# Assignment for Class 6 - AJAX and JSON

Asynchronous connections and standardized data formats? Persistent storage for each client? This all sounds like a serious upgrade to our application logic! Let's see what we can do with our app, once we apply these concepts.

## User Stories
 1. As a developer, I want to use the same template for Articles, so that I don't have to update it in 2 places.
 - As a reader, I only want to download all the blog posts if there are changes, so that the page is faster and everyone saves bandwidth.
 - As a reader, I want the site to have good typography, so that it's easy on the eyes.

### Bonus Stories (2 point each)
 - As a reader, I want the app to remember what tab I'm on, so that if I refresh, I'm not lost.
 - As an author, I want the data in the New Article form to survive a refresh, so that if I go away and come back, my draft is still there.


## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
 - Continue to follow good SMACSS principles.
 - Be sure to use the correct jQuery method for each AJAX call.
 - Be thoughtful when functions are executed asynchronously. This is a major source of bugs!
 - Keep a local cache of article data. Ensure you are only requesting the full blogArticles.json file when you need an update.
 - Log to the console on every cache hit and cache miss.
